# DevNet SQL Project  

![DevNet SQL Project](devnet-cover.png)  

The **DevNet SQL Project** is a **Windows desktop application** developed with **C# and MySQL** as my **final project for term 4** of my **Database Design & Programming coursework**.  

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing customer and employee data. It was designed to simulate how a retail-oriented database system can store, display, and update order and employee information efficiently.
